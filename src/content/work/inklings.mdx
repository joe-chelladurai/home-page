<Introduction
  request="Approached by a client with a deep commitment to cancer awareness and support, my team and I embarked on an exciting project. The client's vision was to create Run for Cancer, a platform designed to enhance awareness, support fundraising efforts, and cultivate community engagement through running events focused on cancer. "
  outcome="Our ambition was to develop a platform that was not only effective but also functional and resonant with the clientâ€™s vision. This project was more than just a job; it was an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to a cause deeply rooted in community and support"

<Overview
  problemDescription="Developing a central platform for raising cancer awareness, engaging communities, and fundraising through running events."
  outcomeDescription="We developed Run for Cancer, a prototype website uniting runners, survivors, and supporters. It features event registration, donation options, and community sharing, all achieved in two weeks."

<CaseStudyFeature
  title="Feature 1"
  description="A more gentle  dedicated donation page"
  text="We added a donation page that helps people know what they are donating for before asking the donation. Too often, nonprofit pages jump to donate button without sharing context or building trust. We address this simultaneously by journeying along with the visitor to give a seamless and unimposed experience."

This feature not only humanizes the cause but also builds a supportive community, encouraging others to participate and share their own stories, creating a powerful and emotionally resonant space."
