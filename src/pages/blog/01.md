Why does your nonprofit need a website?

On the surface, it may seem that a website is a nice to have online. That is only a part of it. With the power of digital reach and technology, a website becomes more than a virtual business card. It can help to provide identity, awareness, and foster community and loyalty. All these aspects resepresent good business and management practices. A website is integral in bridging the ideals of the nonprofit to the volunteers and donors.

Traditionally, a website has been thought of a place where people look to get information about what to do next.

There is more to this.

We can deliver powerful, empathetic, and authentic stories and narratives through digital media and the web.

With privacy focused analytics, we can get key insights into how our visitors use our website. When fundraising and gathering support is crucial, we can optimise the website to achieve the purposes of campaigns and so on.

We can also connect the data through backend systems like Salesforce for Nonprofits and ensure that we deliver automated and leak free approaches to donor management and awareness.

This takes the stress out for you and will help you focus on the things that matter most for your nonprofit.

In this ebook, we share how you can get started, how you can make your site running, integrate popular customer/donor management systems, and have the peace of mind to focus on the values of your organization without having to worry about technical and operational challenges each day.

We'll also integrate donor data from the website to a donor relationship management software using salesforce. This will help systematically keep the processes functional for optimal service.
